# Fraud_Detection_ML

Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains a mix of genuine and fraudulent transactions, and the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent activities.

Dataset

File: creditcard.xlsx

Description: Contains transaction records with features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables.

Target Variable: A label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

Files in the Repository

fraud_detection.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

creditcard.xlsx – The dataset used for training and testing.

credit_card_model.pkl – The trained machine learning model for fraud detection.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Steps to Run the Notebook

Open fraud_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Load the dataset and preprocess the data.

Train the machine learning model.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Save and load the trained model (credit_card_model.pkl).

Model Used

Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or other classifiers.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Results

The model is trained to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

Performance is evaluated based on key classification metrics.

Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

Optimize feature selection and engineering.

Deploy the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle.
