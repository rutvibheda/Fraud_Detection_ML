# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains a mix of genuine and fraudulent transactions, and the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent activities.

## Dataset
- **File:** `creditcard.xlsx`
- **Description:** Contains transaction records with features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables.
- **Target Variable:** A label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

## Files in the Repository
- **`fraud_detection.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **`creditcard.xlsx`** – The dataset used for training and testing.
- **`credit_card_model.pkl`** – The trained machine learning model for fraud detection.

## Model Used
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

## Results
The model is trained to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Performance is evaluated based on key classification metrics.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle.
